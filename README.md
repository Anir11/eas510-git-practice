# EAS510 GIT PRACTICE
I've always been drawn to solving tough, real-world puzzles, and for me, that's what AI is all about. It's more than just code and algorithms; it's a way to make a genuine difference in important areas that affect us all, like healthcare and finance.

My classes in Machine Learning and NLP were fantastic for building a foundation, but I'm the kind of person who learns best by doing. The real "a-ha!" moments for me came when I started building things—like a model that could analyze medical scans and a tool to make complex medical reports easier to understand. That’s when it all clicked: seeing how code could actually help people.

That passion for practical AI led me to an internship where I worked on a financial LLM. It was an incredible experience that showed me firsthand how we can use AI to build smarter and more helpful financial tools.

Now, I'm continuing that journey as a Master's student at the University at Buffalo, getting deeper into computer vision and reinforcement learning. My goal is simple: I want to keep building smart, useful things that make a real difference.
